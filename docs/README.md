## What is alana-utilities?
This library is designed to make interacting with Claude fast and easy. It is primarily targetted toward people writing non-production, prototype code. It prioritizes developer ergonomics.

It speeds up lots of things that I frequently find myself doing with Claude.

- Generating a response to a user and system prompt `alana.gen(user=..., system=...)`
- Creating and/or extending a list of MessageParams `alana.respond(message_content, role="user")`
- Extracting content from Claude's output using Regex `alana.get_xml(tag, content)`
- Generate a prompt or a Python list of few-shot examples `alana.gen_prompt` & `alana.few_shot` respectively

## What is alana?
I am alana :)

## Motivating Examples
*I tested these, and I've tried to make sure my code was idiomatic in all cases. Sorry if I messed up! Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alat-rights/alana-utilities/issues) if you catch a mistake.*

Continuing a list of messages using Anthropic API (adapted from [Anthropic API documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post)):
```Python
import anthropic
from anthropic.types import MessageParam
messages = [
  MessageParam(
    role="user",
    content="Hello, Claude!"
  ),
]
output_text = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=messages
).content[0].text
messages.append(
  MessageParam(
    role="assistant",
    content=output_text
  )
)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

Equivalent `alana` code:
```Python
import alana
messages = []
alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!", messages=messages, model="opus", max_tokens=1024)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

Also, equivalent `alana` code thanks to defaults:
```Python
import alana
messages = []
alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!", messages=messages)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

## Install Instructions
```Python
pip install alana
```
üéµ Note: I have been making new releases frequently. Make sure your package is up-to-date!

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This library is in active early development! No guarantees are made for backward compatibility. The library is NOT production-ready.

## Usage Instructions
1. Import via `import alana` or, if you're brave, `from alana import *`.
2. Make your Anthropic API key available as an environment variable. `os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "..."`

The documentation for this project is hosted at [utils.alana.computer](https://utils.alana.computer).

## Philosophy
- Programming is too slow! This is doubly true when you're interacting with LLMs. By building nice utilities with sane defaults, I hope to speed up my (and maybe your) workflow.
- I make trade-offs to speed up the developer experience:
  - I do not try hard to anticipate future upstream API changes. I'm also ok with breaking backward compatibility to make my functions more concise and more usable.
  - Usability > Principles. While I don't relish in it, I'm ok with breaking conventions designed for large production libraries if it speeds up programmers who use `alana`. The priority is to make the library intuitive and fast.
  - I don't try to serve every use-case.
- Simplicity is key. This library strives to be readable and straightforward.

## Features
- Easy color print: `alana.red`, `alana.green`, `alana.blue`, `alana.yellow`, `alana.cyan`. Try `alana.green("Hello!")`
- Easy pretty print with Sonnet (or an Anthropic model of your choice): `alana.pretty_print`. Try `alana.pretty_print(t.arange(16, device='cpu').reshape(2,2,4))`
- Make it easier to use the Anthropic API:
  - `alana.gen`, for easy Claude generations. Try `alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!")`. You can pass in a `messages` parameter (a list of anthropic.types.MessageParams) either in place of or together with a `user` parameter.
  - `alana.respond`, easily appending a user message to a list of MessageParams!
  - `alana.gen_examples`, `alana.gen_examples_list` for generating few-shot examples.
  - `alana.gen_prompt`, for easy prompt generation (meta-prompt).
  - `alana.get_xml`, for using regex to get XML tag contents from model outputs. ‚ö†Ô∏è Regex parsing of XML may be unreliable!
  - `alana.remove_xml` to strip certain XML tag-enclosed content from a string (along with the tags). This is primarily intended to get rid of "<reasoning>...</reasoning>" strings. ‚ö†Ô∏è Regex parsing of XML may be unreliable!
- A bunch of aliases (Try: `alana.few_shot`, `alana.n_shot`, or `alana.xml`)

## Contributing
Welcome! Thank you for considering making a contribution to `alana-utilities`.

### Getting started
If you'd like to make a major refactor or breaking change, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/alat-rights/alana-utilities/issues) first. This way, I can review it to determine if it is within scope for this project.

There are no guarantees that your pull requests will be merged into the library. `alana-utilities` is essentially a hobby project, and there is currently only one maintainer.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr).

### Style and formating
We are using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting and [PyRight](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking.

Before submitting a pull request, please run `black .` on your code. This saves us from failed CI runs.

To install and run `Black`:
```commandline
  $ pip install black
  $ black .
```

To install and run `PyRight`:
```commandline
  $ pip install pyright
  $ pyright .
```

### Testing
There are simple tests written with `unittest`. I am working on extending the test suite.

You may need to provide your Anthropic API key as an environment variable to run all of the unit tests. See [#10](https://github.com/alat-rights/alana-utilities/issues/10).

First install flaky plugin with `pip`:
```
$ pip install flaky
```
Next run:
```
$ python simple_tests.py
```

## Coming Soon
- Generating alternative prompts given a prompt
- OpenAI model support
- Support for automatic "are you sure"/"are you confused" multi-turn prompting
- Automatic error checking (are there mistakes in this code, sanity checking of model outputs)
- Automatic model-switching on rate limit
- Support for quick-and-dirty unit-testing with Claude!
- Prompt test case generation and easy prompt testing
