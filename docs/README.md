# ‚öôÔ∏é alana-utilities 

Simple utilities library to make prototyping with Claude faster and more fun.

## Install Instructions
```
pip install alana
```
üéµ Note: I have been making new releases frequently. Make sure your package is up-to-date!

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This library is in active early development! No guarantees are made for backward compatibility. The library is NOT production-ready.

## Usage Instructions
1. Import via `import alana` or, if you're brave, `from alana import *`.
2. Make your Anthropic API key available as an environment variable. `os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "..."`

The documentation for this project is hosted at [utils.alana.computer](https://utils.alana.computer).

## Motivating Examples
*I tested these, and I've tried to make sure my code was idiomatic in all cases. Sorry if I messed up! Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/alat-rights/alana-utilities/issues) if you catch a mistake.*

Continuing a list of messages using Anthropic API (adapted from [Anthropic API documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post)):
```
import anthropic
from anthropic.types import MessageParam
messages = [
  MessageParam(
    role="user",
    content="Hello, Claude!"
  ),
]
output_text = anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=messages
).content[0].text
messages.append(
  MessageParam(
    role="assistant",
    content=output_text
  )
)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

Equivalent `alana` code:
```
import alana
messages = []
alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!", messages=messages, model="opus", max_tokens=1024)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

Also, equivalent `alana` code thanks to defaults:
```
import alana
messages = []
alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!", messages=messages)
print(messages)  # [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello, Claude!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Hello! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today?"}]
```

## Is this for me?
This library is mostly designed for me (hence the name), but they might be helpful for you too!

Here are some questions to ask yourself when considering whether to use this library:

- Do you interact with LLMs? (Currently, only Anthropic LLMs are supported).
- Do you value conciseness?
- Are you writing **non-production prototype code**, where 1, occassional bugs and behavioral changes are acceptable, and 2, developer ergonomics are more important than performance?
  - Note: This library *strongly* assumes this use-case! e.g. `alana.gen` actually writes to the console by default (you can disable this with `loud=False`).
- Do the features appeal to you?

## Philosophy
- Programming is too slow! This is doubly true when you're interacting with LLMs. By building nice utilities with sane defaults, I hope to speed up my (and maybe your) workflow.
- I make trade-offs to speed up the developer experience:
  - I do not try hard to anticipate future upstream API changes. I'm also ok with breaking backward compatibility to make my functions more concise and more usable.
  - Usability > Principles. While I don't relish in it, I'm ok with breaking conventions designed for large production libraries if it speeds up programmers who use `alana`. The priority is to make the library intuitive and fast.
  - I don't try to serve every use-case.
- Simplicity is key. This library strives to be readable and straightforward.

## Features
- Easy color print: `alana.red`, `alana.green`, `alana.blue`, `alana.yellow`, `alana.cyan`. Try `alana.green("Hello!")`
- Easy pretty print with Sonnet (or an Anthropic model of your choice): `alana.pretty_print`. Try `alana.pretty_print(t.arange(16, device='cpu').reshape(2,2,4))`
- Make it easier to use the Anthropic API:
  - `alana.gen`, for easy Claude generations. Try `alana.gen(user="Hello, Claude!")`. You can pass in a `messages` parameter (a list of anthropic.types.MessageParams) either in place of or together with a `user` parameter.
  - `alana.respond`, easily appending a user message to a list of MessageParams!
  - `alana.gen_examples`, `alana.gen_examples_list` for generating few-shot examples.
  - `alana.gen_prompt`, for easy prompt generation (meta-prompt).
  - `alana.get_xml`, for using regex to get XML tag contents from model outputs. ‚ö†Ô∏è Regex parsing of XML may be unreliable!
  - `alana.remove_xml` to strip certain XML tag-enclosed content from a string (along with the tags). This is primarily intended to get rid of "<reasoning>...</reasoning>" strings. ‚ö†Ô∏è Regex parsing of XML may be unreliable!
- A bunch of aliases (Try: `alana.few_shot`, `alana.n_shot`, or `alana.xml`)

## Testing
There are simple tests written with `unittest`. I am working on extending the test suite.

You may need to provide your Anthropic API key as an environment variable to run all of the unit tests. See [#10](https://github.com/alat-rights/alana-utilities/issues/10).

First install flaky plugin with `pip`:
```
$ pip install flaky
```
Next run:
```
$ python simple_tests.py
```

## Coming Soon
- Generating alternative prompts given a prompt
- OpenAI model support
- Support for automatic "are you sure"/"are you confused" multi-turn prompting
- Automatic error checking (are there mistakes in this code, sanity checking of model outputs)
- Automatic model-switching on rate limit
- Support for quick-and-dirty unit-testing with Claude!
- Prompt test case generation and easy prompt testing
